Global constraints:
- Prioritize readability (high contrast, clear hierarchy).
- Use consistent typography and spacing across all slides.
- Keep visuals purposeful; avoid decorative clutter.

Minimal theme:
- Background: white or near-white.
- Text: near-black (#111–#222), one sans-serif font family.
- Accents: a single muted accent color for highlights and rules.
- Simple icons/illustrations only when they clarify meaning.
