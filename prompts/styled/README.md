# Styled prompts (v2)

This folder holds per-page “styled prompts”: slide-by-slide, design-complete prompts that include layout decisions, typography guidance, and any required visual elements (tables/figures/code blocks).

- Input: `prompts/content/<deck>.md` + a style brief in `styles/<style>.md`
- Output: `prompts/styled/<deck>.md`

Use these as the input to artifact generation (images + PDF/PPTX), writing intermediates into `artifacts/<deck>/work/`.
