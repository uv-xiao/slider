# Content prompts (v2)

This folder holds per-page “content prompts”: slide-by-slide plans that preserve *all* information from source material, while optimizing density and logical flow.

- Input: `materials/<deck>/...` (raw notes/images/etc.)
- Output: `prompts/content/<deck>.md`

The next step is to convert these into styled prompts under `prompts/styled/`.
