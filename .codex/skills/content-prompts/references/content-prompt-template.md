# Content PROMPT template (v2)

Use this as the canonical structure for `prompts/content/<deck>.md`.

```markdown
# Deck: <title>

Context:
- Audience: <...>
- Use case: <live talk | shareable doc | training>
- Target length: <time or slide/page count>
- Language: <...>

Rules:
- One main idea per page.
- No silent dropping: everything important goes into “Must include”.
- If a figure/table/diagram is needed, specify what it must convey (and data if available).

## Page 1: <narrative headline takeaway>

Intent:
- <why this page exists in the story arc>

Must include:
- <facts/claims/code/assets that must appear>

Suggested representation:
- Primary: <bullets | diagram | table | code | screenshot | illustration>
- Optional: <supporting small visual>

Assets:
- <local paths or URLs, with captions and placement intent>

Notes / TODO:
- <missing data, open questions>
```
