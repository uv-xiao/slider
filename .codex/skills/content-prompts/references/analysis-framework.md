# Presentation analysis framework (adapted from archived v1)

This is a condensed version of the best parts of:

- `archieve/v1/.codex/skills/baoyu-slide-deck/references/analysis-framework.md`

Use it before writing `prompts/content/<deck>.md`.

## 1) Message hierarchy

- **Core message (≤15 words)**: if the audience remembers one thing, what is it?
- **Supporting points (3–5)**: evidence that supports the core message.
- **Call-to-action**: what should the audience do/decide next?

## 2) Audience decision matrix

Answer:

- Who is the audience (role, expertise, context)?
- What do they currently believe/assume?
- What decision/action do we want?
- What barriers/objections exist?
- What evidence will convince them (data vs demos vs stories)?

## 3) Visual opportunity map

Map content → best representation:

- Comparison → side-by-side / table
- Process → flow diagram / numbered steps
- Hierarchy → tree / pyramid
- Timeline → timeline graphic
- Metrics → chart + annotated insight
- Relationships → network / venn
- Concepts → icon set + concrete metaphor

## 4) Presentation flow patterns

Pick a narrative backbone:

- Problem → solution → evidence → implications
- Situation → complication → resolution
- What → why → how
- Past → present → future
- Claim → evidence → implication

## 5) Coverage check (no silent dropping)

- Every source section ends up in exactly one page’s “Must include” (or a TODO if unclear).
- Split pages that carry multiple intents or competing representations.
