# Pipeline notes (v2 Styled PROMPT → Artifacts)

- Keep all intermediates under `artifacts/<deck>/work/` (slides, downloads, rasterized images, logs).
- Some providers reject SVG attachments; rasterize to PNG before attaching.
- If you see inconsistent styling across slides, attach the previous slide image to the next generation call.
