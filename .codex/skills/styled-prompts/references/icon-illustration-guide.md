# Icons & illustrations guide (v2)

Adapted from the “visual opportunity” and “consistent visual language” guidance in archived v1 skills.

## Icons

- Use **2–4 icons** max per slide (unless the slide is an icon grid).
- Keep a **single icon style** across a deck (outline vs filled; consistent stroke width).
- Icons should encode meaning (category, status, step), not decoration.

## Illustrations

Write deterministic briefs:

- subjects (who/what), pose, props
- viewpoint (front/3/4/isometric), composition (where placed)
- background treatment (none / subtle texture / grid)
- style constraints (line weight, color palette, shading)

Avoid illustrations that contain lots of unrequested text.

## Tables

Tables are visual objects:

- specify full data
- specify header styling, row banding, padding, and which cells to highlight
- add 1 short insight annotation (callout)
